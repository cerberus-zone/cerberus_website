  :::

::: details What do you mean by the ratio that I will receive?

This airdrop will not be based on set mininum amount of $HUAHUA, $ATOM, or $OSMO that you hold.

Here are several simple examples of how the airdrop allocation ratio would work.

<div style="color:red; font-weight: bold">These ratios are strictly for EXAMPLE ONLY!</div>

- If the ratio were 1:1 and you held 1,000 $HUAHUA you would receive 1,000 $CRBRUS.

- If the ratio were 1:0.5 and you held 1,000 $HUAHUA you would receive 500 $CRBRUS.

- If the ratio were 1:0.25 and you held 1,000 $HUAHUA you would receive 250 $CRBRUS.

<div style="color:red; font-weight: bold">These ratios are strictly for EXAMPLE ONLY! Exact ratios to come at a later date.</div>

:::

::: details How is the ratio calculated?

Quick answer

Once we have snapshots from the validators, we will see how many wallets exist, and the total amount of assets ($HUAHUA, $ATOM, and $OSMO) held and then run a formula based on that to give us the ratio.

There will be separate snapshots for $HUAHUA, $ATOM, and $OSMO.

:::

::: details If I am staking/delegating $HUAHUA, $ATOM, and $OSMO will I receive all three airdrops.

You can stake $CRBRUS here -> <a href="https://stake.cerberus.zone/" target="_blank">Cerberus Web Wallet</a>

:::

::: details Why not give everyone the same amount no matter how much they are staking?

There are multiple reasons behind our reason for doing the airdrop this way.

- Those who are early supporters of other networks such as $HUAHUA, $ATOM, or $OSMO and invested in securing those chains by staking should be rewarded based on the merit of their efforts. We don't believe in getting "something for nothing."
- Avoids individuals trying to game the system by creating multiple wallet addresses and staking the minimum to claim an airdrop numerous times in different wallets. ðŸ˜‰
  :::
