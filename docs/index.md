:::

::: details Why not give everyone the same amount no matter how much they are staking?

There are multiple reasons behind our reason for doing the airdrop this way.

- Those who are early supporters of other networks such as $HUAHUA, $ATOM, or $OSMO and invested in securing those chains by staking should be rewarded based on the merit of their efforts. We don't believe in getting "something for nothing."
- Avoids individuals trying to game the system by creating multiple wallet addresses and staking the minimum to claim an airdrop numerous times in different wallets. ðŸ˜‰
  :::

::: details Are Twitter Giveaways the same as the $HUAHUA, $ATOM, or $OSMO Airdrops ?
No, Twitter airdrops are for completing a task on Twitter. Task usually are:

- Following us on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/CerberusZone" target="_blank">@CerberusZone</a>
